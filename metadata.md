## <a name="metadata"></a> 3. Metadata requirements/Practices
Explains what [codebooks](#codebook), [data dictionaries](#dataDictionary), [value labels](#valueLabels), and [variable labels](#variableLabels) are, when they are used, what they should contain, and why they are important.  Binding metadata to the data source helps ensure that there is always sufficient documentation built into the data to allow any end user to more quickly/easily get up and running with a data set.  These sections should also explain when these elements are required as part of data deliverables.

### <a name="codebook"></a> Codebooks
This section would explain what a codebook is.  Codebooks have two primary functions:

	1. Explain numeric mappings to semantic meanings 
	2. Show basic distribution properties of a variable

For example, if we code student sex with a [bit](#dataTypes) type with values of 0 and 1 how would an end user know which numeric value represents female?  The codebook would provide this explanation as well as show the distribution of some/all of the values for basic validation/verification:

Value | Label  | Freq. | Pct.
----- | ------ | ----- | -----
0     | Male   | 4,900 | 49%
1     | Female | 5,100 | 51%
